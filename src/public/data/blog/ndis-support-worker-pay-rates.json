These rates depend on various factors, including the worker's qualifications and the time of the support provided. For example, unqualified support workers might earn between $30.96 and $35.08 per hour, while team leaders could earn up to $42.31 per hour, based on 2024 figures.</p><h1 id=\"\">Factors Affecting Pay Rates</h1><p id=\"\">Pay rates can vary significantly:</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Time of Day and Day of Week</strong>: Daytime rates (6 am to 8 pm on weekdays) are standard, but evening (8 pm to midnight), night, weekend, and public holiday rates are higher.</li><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Type of Support</strong>: Standard assistance might have different rates compared to high-intensity support.</li><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Provider Type</strong>: TTP providers may charge slightly higher rates.</li></ul><h1 id=\"\">Current Rates and Examples</h1><p id=\"\">Here's a table summarizing approximate pay rates based on the SCHADS Award 2024/2025, which applies to NDIS support workers:</p><div data-rt-embed-type='true'><table style=\"width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 20px 0; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><thead><tr style=\"background-color: #f7f7f7;\"><th style=\"padding: 12px 15px; text-align: left; border-bottom: 2px solid #ddd;\">Category</th><th style=\"padding: 12px 15px; text-align: left; border-bottom: 2px solid #ddd;\">Hourly Rate Range (AUD)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"padding: 12px 15px; border-bottom: 1px solid #eee;\">Unqualified Support Workers</td><td style=\"padding: 12px 15px; border-bottom: 1px solid #eee;\">$30.96 – $35.08</td></tr><tr><td style=\"padding: 12px 15px; border-bottom: 1px solid #eee;\">Qualified Support Workers</td><td style=\"padding: 12px 15px; border-bottom: 1px solid #eee;\">$33.02 – $37.15</td></tr><tr><td style=\"padding: 12px 15px; border-bottom: 1px solid #eee;\">Team Leaders/Supervisors</td><td style=\"padding: 12px 15px; border-bottom: 1px solid #eee;\">$37.15 – $42.31</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p id=\"\">For instance, a weekday daytime shift might be at the lower end, while a public holiday night shift could be significantly higher, though exact multipliers weren't found.</p><h1 id=\"\">Understanding the Factors Affecting Pay Rates</h1><p id=\"\">Pay rates for NDIS support workers are not fixed and vary based on several dimensions:</p><ol id=\"\"><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Time of Day and Day of Week</strong>:<ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">The NDIS defines specific time periods for claiming purposes, as detailed on MyCareSpace. For example:<ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Weekday Daytime Support</strong>: Any support from 6 am to 8 pm on Monday to Friday, unless it's a public holiday or night-time sleepover.</li><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Weekday Evening Support</strong>: From 8 pm to midnight on weekdays.</li><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Weekday Night Support (Active Overnight)</strong>: Starting at or before midnight and finishing after midnight on a weekday.</li><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Weekend Daytime Support</strong>: 6 am to 8 pm on Saturdays or Sundays.</li><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Weekend Evening Support</strong>: 8 pm to midnight on weekends.</li><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Public Holiday Support</strong>: Any support provided on a public holiday, typically at the highest rates.</li></ul></li><li id=\"\">Research suggests that evening and night rates are higher than daytime rates, with weekend and public holiday rates being even higher to compensate for non-standard hours.</li></ul></li><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Type of Support</strong>:<ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">Support can be categorized into standard, high-intensity, or specialized services.

Self-managed participants can negotiate rates outside the price limits, while plan-managed and agency-managed participants are bound by NDIS price limits, as explained on MyCareSpace. TTP providers, who receive additional funding, may charge slightly higher rates, though this loading ended on June 30, 2024, according to NDIS Pricing Updates.</li></ul></li></ol><h1 id=\"\">Current Pay Rates and Detailed Breakdown</h1><p id=\"\">Based on the SCHADS Award 2024/2025, which is relevant for NDIS support workers, the following pay rates were identified from Carelogy:</p><div data-rt-embed-type='true'><table style=\"width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 20px 0; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><thead><tr style=\"background-color: #f7f7f7;\"><th style=\"padding: 12px 15px; text-align: left; border-bottom: 2px solid #ddd;\">Category</th><th style=\"padding: 12px 15px; text-align: left; border-bottom: 2px solid #ddd;\">Hourly Rate Range (AUD)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"padding: 12px 15px; border-bottom: 1px solid #eee;\">Unqualified Support Workers</td><td style=\"padding: 12px 15px; border-bottom: 1px solid #eee;\">$30.96 – $35.08</td></tr><tr><td style=\"padding: 12px 15px; border-bottom: 1px solid #eee;\">Qualified Support Workers</td><td style=\"padding: 12px 15px; border-bottom: 1px solid #eee;\">$33.02 – $37.15</td></tr><tr><td style=\"padding: 12px 15px; border-bottom: 1px solid #eee;\">Team Leaders/Supervisors</td><td style=\"padding: 12px 15px; border-bottom: 1px solid #eee;\">$37.15 – $42.31</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p id=\"\">These rates may vary depending on whether the worker is casual or permanent, with casual workers potentially earning more due to the absence of benefits like paid leave. Additionally, the rates can increase for evening, night, weekend, and public holiday shifts, though exact multipliers weren't specified in the data. For example, an overnight sleepover might include a flat rate plus additional pay for active hours, with rates like $224.58 for plan-managed clients and $204.16 for agency-managed clients, as mentioned on Careseekers Blog, though these figures may need updating for 2024/2025.</p><h1 id=\"\">NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Support Catalogue</h1><p id=\"\">The NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits, effective from October 1, 2024, provide the framework for these rates, as detailed on NDIS Pricing Arrangements. The Support Catalogue, updated for 2024-25, lists all support items and their price limits, ensuring participants receive value for money. The NDIS Disability Support Worker Cost Model, updated to reflect efficient provider cost structures, is the basis for these limits, available as a PDF on the same page.</p><h1 id=\"\">Recent Changes and Updates</h1><p id=\"\">Recent updates include a 3.75% increase in SCHADS Award pay rates from July 1, 2024, linked to the Consumer Price Index, as noted on Workstem. The Temporary Transformation Payment (TTP) ended on June 30, 2024, affecting provider billing, as per NDIS Pricing Updates. These changes are crucial for staying compliant with current standards.</p><h1 id=\"\">Comparison with Other Roles</h1><p id=\"\">Compared to the median hourly earnings for all Australian employees in 2023, which were $39.50 per hour according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (as cited on Carelogy), NDIS support worker rates are competitive, especially for qualified workers and team leaders. This comparison highlights the sector's alignment with broader wage trends.</p><h1 id=\"\">Tips for Support Workers and Participants</h1><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Negotiating Pay Rates</strong>: Self-managed participants can negotiate rates, potentially lowering costs by hiring directly, as noted on MyCareSpace.

Staying informed about the SCHADS Award, NDIS Pricing Arrangements, and recent updates ensures fair compensation and efficient funding use.
